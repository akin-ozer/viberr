/**
 * Ruling 107 — what a controller turn MOUNTS, and what it is told about it.
 *
 * The "not removable by anyone" mechanism is not a guard that refuses a
 * removal: it is that no removal exists. `buildControllerMounts` reads no
 * config and consults no grant row, so `viberr_ops` is attached on every turn
 * for the same reason `viberr_controller` is. These lock that, plus the one
 * persona sentence that tells the model the tools are there — a prompt that
 * promises tools a run does not carry is the failure this pairing prevents.
