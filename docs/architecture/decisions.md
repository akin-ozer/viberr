# Binding decisions & conventions

This is the normative contract that code comments across the tree cite as **CONVENTIONS**
and as **"orchestrator ruling N"**. It condenses
[`planning/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`](../../planning/planning-artifacts/architecture.md),
which wins on conflict.

**Provenance.** The content below was recovered from `docs/build/CONVENTIONS.md`, which was
deleted in commit c1acf2c ("Remove obsolete code and simplify project structure") along
with the rest of `docs/build/`. Sixteen comments in fifteen files still cited it by name
and another ten cited its numbered rulings, so the deletion left binding decisions
readable nowhere — the exact failure mode that produced the six regressions commit cbcfe77
had to repair. The ruling **numbers are preserved verbatim** so every existing `ruling N`
citation resolves here.

**How to read a superseded ruling.** Several rulings have been narrowed or reversed by a
later owner decision. Those are marked **SUPERSEDED** inline, with what replaced them and
when. A superseded ruling is kept, not deleted: its number is still cited in code, and
knowing what the old rule *was* is how you avoid re-implementing it. Never restore a
superseded rule because you found the ruling text.

## Layout

```
app/
  root.tsx, routes.ts, app.css, entry.client.tsx, entry.server.tsx
  routes/          # thin route modules only; delegate to features/server
  ui/              # reusable primitives — MUST NOT import from features/
  lib/             # better-auth instance + its Viberr bridge
  features/        # per-surface UI + loaders/actions glue
  schemas/         # shared Zod schemas (task-file, project-file, sse-event, github-pat)
  server/          # server-only modules
  shared/          # narrow cross-surface helpers
db/migrations/*.sql   scripts/*.ts   e2e/   test-support/
```

The live folder inventory is in
[`architecture.md`'s directory structure](../../planning/planning-artifacts/architecture.md#complete-project-directory-structure);
it is regenerated from the filesystem rather than restated here.

- Server-only files: `*.server.ts` suffix. Never import server modules into client
  components.
- Tests co-located: `foo.server.test.ts`. No `utils.ts` / `helpers.ts` dumping grounds.
- Files/dirs kebab-case; components/types PascalCase; vars/functions camelCase; constants
  UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.

## Data & naming

- **SQLite:** plural snake_case tables (`users`, `sessions`, `task_projections`,
  `audit_events`), snake_case columns, `<entity>_id` FKs, `idx_<table>__<cols>` indexes. DB
  rows map to camelCase through the centralized mapping modules in `app/shared/mapping/` —
  never ad hoc at a call site.
- **TS/JSON:** camelCase. Timestamps are UTC ISO 8601 strings at all boundaries and in
  files. Booleans stay booleans; null stays null.
- **Readiness values** are exactly `ready` | `input_required` |
  `inconsistency_risk_detected` | `blocked`. Derivation lives ONLY in
  `app/server/interpretation/readiness-policy.server.ts`.
- **JSON endpoints** (rare, only for automation): success `{ data, meta? }`, error
  `{ error: { code, message, details? } }`, real HTTP status codes. Loaders return
  route-shaped data directly; route *actions* are exempt and return their own result
  shapes.
- **SSE:** event names are lowercase dot-separated facts (`task.updated`,
  `task.readiness-changed`, `projection.rebuilt`, `run.log-appended`,
  `auth.session-expired`); payload is `{ type, entityId, occurredAt, data }` — compact
  facts and references, never fat objects. The wire shape is parsed before publish because
  it is a contract.
- **Errors:** typed `AppError` with stable machine codes (`app/server/errors/`). Never leak
  stack traces or secrets to users. Distinguish user-correctable / inconsistency-diagnostic
  / infrastructure.

## Behavior rules

- Files are the only canonical business truth. The app writes files through dedicated
  writer modules (frontmatter-preserving), then re-parses → re-projects → publishes SSE.
  Never write projections without file backing for task/project state.
- Tolerant parsing: malformed input produces diagnostics plus a readiness downgrade
  (`input_required` / `inconsistency_risk_detected` / `blocked`), never a crash, never a
  silent drop.
- No optimistic UI for governed state. Revalidate after the action and on SSE.
- Mutating actions must be idempotent-safe (idempotency keys or existence checks) — a
  retry must not duplicate transitions, branches, PRs or events.
- Every governed action (approval, transition, ownership change, policy change, PAT change,
  run start/interrupt) writes an audit event and, where user-visible, a typed timeline
  event in `task.md`.
- Secrets come only from env; PATs are AES-256-GCM encrypted in SQLite; secrets never
  appear in files under `projects/`, in logs, in SSE payloads, or in error messages.
- RBAC applies to actions, not to file existence. Agents get a per-project capability
  policy, enforced server-side on agent-triggered actions.
- Human-only, enforced server-side: transition to Done, and completion acceptance.
  **Narrowed** — see ruling 2 and the note under FR27 in the PRD: under the `auto` preset,
  a full-autonomy operator holding an explicit `completion-for-acceptance: direct` grant
  may accept and move a task to Done itself. That is the one deliberate exception, and it
  is disclosed in the UI. Every other path to Done stays human.

## UI porting rules

- The mock (`design/html-app/app/*.jsx`) is the design source of truth: reproduce
  structure, class names and behavior 1:1, unless the mock is prototype-only (localStorage
  session, `location.href` page hops, `window.VIBERR` globals) — replace those with real
  routes/loaders/actions/SSE. Record deliberate departures from the mock in a comment at
  the departure site.
- Keep `viberr.css` classes and CSS variables exactly; add new CSS only in clearly-marked
  appended sections of `app/app.css`. No Tailwind, no inline hex colors — use the existing
  tokens. A `var(--x)` that is not defined in `:root` is a bug, not a style choice.
- Icons: one ported `Icon` component in `app/ui/icon.tsx`, reused everywhere.
- Theme: light/dark/system, persisted per user (profile) plus a cookie for SSR-safe first
  paint.
- Toasts for action feedback; packet-styled confirm dialogs. A failure toast must not
  render the success tick — pass the toast kind explicitly.
- Loading states: React Router pending state. No spinners-forever; long operations report
  server-derived progress.
- Accessibility: keep the mock's `aria-*` usage, visible focus, keyboard menus and dialogs
  (Escape closes, scrim click closes). The WCAG 2.2 AA baseline in
  [the PRD](../../planning/planning-artifacts/prd.md) applies to core workflows in both
  themes.

## ORCHESTRATOR RULINGS (binding)

1. **Readiness.** Canonical 4-value enum in files, Zod and SQLite; ONE mapping module maps
   it to the mock's pill CSS kinds/labels (`input`, `risk`, …). "Accepted" is a derived
   display state (stage done + accepted), never a stored readiness.
2. **Roles: three separate systems, kept separate.** Org roles `admin|member` (the schema
   tolerates `viewer`; the UI uses admin|member). Project membership roles stored in
   `project.md` and enforced server-side. Agent capability policy per profile
   (`direct|recommend|human`), id-based against a shared capability catalog
   (`{capabilityId, mode}` plus display-only extras), with an always-human server invariant
   list: merge PR, transition to done, change project policy.
   **Amended** — the project roles are now `admin | maintainer | contributor | viewer`
   (`reviewer` was renamed `contributor`), they form a strict tier, and the grant table
   lives in one place, `app/shared/rbac.ts`, which both the guards and the Policy page
   render from. `view` and `comment` are app-wide by FR4: any authenticated user holds
   them, member or not.
3. **Task-file store** at `$VIBERR_DATA_ROOT/projects/<slug>/tasks/<KEY>/task.md`. The UI
   renders the REAL store-relative path wherever the mock showed `.viberr/...`.
4. **Timestamps.** UTC ISO at all boundaries; one shared formatter in `app/shared/dates/`
   reproducing the mock's display forms (today → `H:MM`, else `{day} · {t}`, relative forms
   for home/store).
5. **PAT scope violations.** Server-derived per-scope validator results plus per-violation
   open/resolved records; the rail badge is the open-violation count; granting or
   re-validating writes a typed timeline event to the violation's OWN task, plus audit and
   SSE. No global boolean.
6. **Identity.** Compare by user id everywhere; display names are render-only. The session
   user id is authoritative.
7. **Packet options carry a stable `kind`** — never dispatch on English titles.
   Accept-completion triggers a real async PR merge with an explicit failure state.
   **Extended** — the kind set is now eight: `accept_completion`, `request_edit`,
   `block_on_policy`, `hold_runtime_debug`, `redirect`, `retry_other_backend`, `edit_goal`,
   `custom`. The same ruling governs the capability catalog: agent policy is id-based
   against the shared catalog, and advisory ids with no runtime consumer get no toggle.
8. **`tweaks-panel.jsx` is not ported** (dev harness, dead code). Review-queue packet and
   acceptance mechanics ship before the queue surface; the queue lives in
   `app/features/review/`.
9. **Notifications** are per-user rows in SQLite sorted by real timestamp DESC;
   task/project references are soft refs.
   **SUPERSEDED in part** (clean-sheet seed ruling, 2026-07-24) — the two stub projects
   this ruling seeded so cross-project rows would navigate are demo data. They live in the
   demo fixture (`npm run seed:demo`) only; the product seed ships no board data.
10. **"Waiting on you" / the review queue stay project-wide in V1** — do not scope per-user,
    do not change the labels.
    **SUPERSEDED for the board** (R8-3): the board's "Waiting on me" chip and the home
    card's waiting count are **member-scoped** — a decision the viewer can actually act on,
    not the project-wide `waiting === "human"` enum. The review queue itself stays
    project-wide.
11. **Run lifecycle** is stored as `queued|running|finished|error|interrupted` and maps to
    the mock pills (queued → neutral "queued"; interrupted → neutral
    "interrupted · by \<actor\>" footer). Raw NDJSON/JSONL is truth; the log line display is
    a projection. Elapsed derives from `startedAt`; tokens come from real usage envelopes
    only, never estimates.
12. **PR states.** merged → done pill; open/draft → "in review"; closed-unmerged → risk
    pill "closed". Sync pill precedence is merged > behind > synced, derived from real
    compare data.
13. **Prefs.** Drop `ghConnected` (derive it from the user row); mount the Appearance
    panel; map plural pref ids ↔ singular notification kinds explicitly, once.
    **Narrowed** — there is no mailer in V1, so the email and nudge preference shapes were
    removed rather than kept schema-only. Each category carries a single in-app `app`
    toggle.
14. **Shared single implementations** for: notification meta, the markdown-ish stripper and
    rich-text renderer, the credential card, and the bell popover (parameterized). Never
    fork these per surface. Toast, empty-state and boundary copy in the specs is a verbatim
    contract, including intentionally divergent board vs review wording.
15. **Stages** are a per-project list in `project.md` (hex or `var(--*)` colors both
    accepted), created from an instance-default workflow template.
    **Narrowed** (P13-AP-04 / owner ruling 2, 2026-07-24) — the "Lightweight · 3 stages"
    preset was **deleted**. The Standard 5-stage board is the only creation template. Custom
    stage lists still exist and are edited per project after creation.
16. **Deliberate keeps:** the board rail count includes Done; `.card.urgent` stays visually
    untreated; `data-screen-label` attributes are kept app-wide. **Additions:** a minimal
    list-view empty state; Escape-close, focus-trap and scrim-click on every dialog (markup
    unchanged); `operator` stores the stage id and the UI renders "stage \<1-based index\>";
    login keeps the mock's copy but the password minimum is 8 characters.
